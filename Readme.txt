+------------------+
| Getting Started: |
+------------------+
Simply run the AutoCode.py file included with this Readme. A new window should open. This window is where you type the code.

+----------------------------+
| Auto Completing For Loops: |
+----------------------------+
Simply type into the text box "for(" (quotes excluded). Once "for(" is on the screen, simply press the CTRL key on your keyboard. Two base completions will be presented in a new window:
>>> i = 0; i < 10; i++)
>>> j = 10; j > 0; j--)
From these two options, simply click on the button you wish to complete your statement with. If you do not wish to use either of them, just close the window.

+------------------------------+
| Auto Completing While Loops: |
+------------------------------+
Simply type into the text box "while(" (quotes excluded). Once "while(" is on the screen, simply press the CTRL key on your keyboard. Two base completions will be presented in a new window:
>>> x > y)
>>> x != y)
From these two options, simply click on the button you wish to complete your statement with. If you do not wish to use either of them, just close the window.

+--------------------------------------------+
| Auto Completing Variables/ Function Names: |
+--------------------------------------------+
At the start of a new line or after a space, simply press CTRL. This will bring up all the currently saved variables/ function names in a new window. Simply click on the one you wish to use. However, at the very start of the program, no variables/ function names are saved. If you wish to use this feature, please look below to learn how to save variables/ function names.

+-----------------------------------+
| Saving Variables/ Function Names: |
+-----------------------------------+
To save a new variable/ function name, simply type the name of it on a new line. It must be by itself on that line. Then, press the ALT key. To make sure it worked correctly, go to a new line (or simply put a space after what you just wrote) and press CTRL. A new window should open with your variable/ function name. You can save up to 5 different variables/ functions. Please be aware that after the 5th one, it will loop back and overwrite the 1st one in the list.

+-----------------------------+
| Saving For Loop Conditions: |
+-----------------------------+
To save a new for loop condition, simply type the entire for loop (i.e., "for(*condition*)" ). Then, press the UP key. To make sure it worked correctly, type "for(" and press CTRL. A new window should open with the previously mentioned 2 base conditions and an additional 3rd condition (your new condition). You can save up to 5 different conditions at a time. Please be aware that after the 5th one, it will loop back and overwrite the 1st one in the list.

+-------------------------------+
| Saving While Loop Conditions: |
+-------------------------------+
To save a new while loop condition, simply type the entire while loop (i.e., "while(*condition*)" ). Then, press the DOWN key. To make sure it worked correctly, type "while(" and press CTRL. A new window should open with the previously mentioned 2 base conditions and an additional 3rd condition (your new condition). You can save up to 5 different conditions at a time. Please be aware that after the 5th one, it will loop back and overwrite the 1st one in the list.
